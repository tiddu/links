Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 December 2021Verified Purchase I thought very long about this review. In some ways, I would have liked to give 5 stars; however, there are a few cons with the purchase. Overall, I would recommend going with this seller for kefir grains. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: —There is EXCELLENT customer service provided from the seller. Mr. Kefir is respectful and caring and truly wants to help make the process go smoothly for his customers. — The grains are covered by a one time 6 months no-questions-asked warranty —The grains are shipped in nice packaging with a spoon, strainer, personal note from the seller, and an instruction manual with contact information. —The grains produce kefir well, which is what the goal is, right!? Cons: — The price is very high for the size and amount of grains you get. —The tiny size of the grains makes straining/finding your grains a little challenging. —The strainer given is not good for straining kefir. It was very challenging to strain my kefir with the double mesh strainer, especially when the temperature was hot, producing very thick kefir so quickly. To solve this problem, I cut out one of the strainer layers with scissors, and the process became a thousand times easier! TAKE NOTE: Sometimes when people think their grains have multiplied/gotten bigger, it may just be kefir curds which have not yet gone through the strainer. This is especially true when using the double mesh strainer. Just because you have big lumps, does not mean you have bigger kefir grains. For those of you who may have a sourdough starter, kefir is similar (definitely not the same, but similar) in how it works with temperature. However, know that kefir grains are more sensitive to temperature changes, so they are not as forgiving as a sourdough starter when you forget to feed them or put them in the fridge. When the kefir grains grow larger, they can stand a little more change, but these baby grains have to be babied. 30 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Mr. Kefir also gives you all the hand holding you may need to learn the process of setting your kefir curd. It's worth the money spent. And best of all I think it has already improved my digestion a good deal after consuming it daily for the last 15 days or so. So I would say, just go for it. Thanks.

I used it at first with whole cow's milk supplied by my neighbourhood dairy, and ran into a few issues because the fat was not evenly distributed in the milk. I sought support from Mr Kefir over the phone and on WhatsApp to overcome these teething problems. His response was simply superb, and he handheld me over the succeeding days to get properly set kefir. After this experience, I can say that the novice should start with pasteurized, homogenized milk. I have shown the packets of two brands that have worked well for me. The kefir is ready once the contents do not move when fermentation bottle is tilted. After straining, the kefir grains may be re-used to make another batch. The resulting kefir is tangy and tart and feels very good to eat. Highly recommended. Enjoy! <img src="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png"/>Chyavana 5.0 out of 5 stars Use pasteurized, homogenized milk for the best results Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 June 2023 I started using kefir grains about three weeks ago.

Well no doubt product is excellent... Before buying I was wondering that it might get damag via transportation. But I got surprised when I saw kefir grains were almost quarter teaspoon (small) with one teaspoon of milk. Well I discard all the liquid and strained the grains... Then I put grains into a glass bottle and poured the milk. But in my first attempt I committed a mistake. I put the bottle into my RICE BOX. And after 24 hours when I checked it was over fermented.. It was looking like COTTAGE CHEESE (PANEER) So ASAP I called Mr kefir and told him everything. So he suggested me to keep the bottle in a CLAY POT filled with little water.. I did the same but here is one interesting thing (MAY BE ITS BCZ OF CLIMATE I GUESS) They say it takes atleast 24 hours to get ready kefir curd but in my case its taking only 10 to 12 hours... I am using Buffalo milk of 6 to 8 fat %age. I've checked it almost 5 times by now. Every time when I put it for 24 hours it bcm more sour (which is good) and two times I found it over fermented(which is not good for grains) Regular over fermentation kills live grains.. SO now I make kefir curd twice in a day. First I put it at 8 pm with almost 500ml buffalo milk. Then in morning I strain it at 7am. Then again I make it at 7 am and strain it 8pm. (it totes depends on the temperature of ur city u r living in) Right now here in north India its almost 43° to 45 ° My curd which is almost look like THICK LASSI is doing great... Mr. Kefir is also very nice and helpful person who showed me the right way... M very health conscious guy... May be in the beginning some will think 1200 bucks are tooooo much for only a few grains (which u even can count) but believe me for a lifetime its just nothing (1200 rs) (according to me). Now my grains are healthy and within a month it grows almost two teaspoon. The pic I've shared is almost 15 days old... There are nothing like big or small grains in size only what matters is how healthy grains u have....Its up on you how to treat them..... Well guys I gave 4 star for is it easy to use or not bcz dealing with live kefir grains is very delicate job. Especially if u r a beginner (like me) it requires lots of care... So its not easy to handle it... I know guys u have done ur homework on kefir grains (how healthy they are) so M not gonna lecture on that...

Before that I had done my reading from various online sources on kefir. The culture received was a small quantity and I could only see small grains. The white liquid was very sour. However I followed the instructions by Mr. Kefir. Lo and behold, within two days we started making ~ 900 ml of kefir every day. We get chilled milk in packets delivered at home in the morning, and is immediately moved to refrigerator. The kefir grains are put in the glass jar (1 litre capacity) and topped up with ~ 900 ml of milk. The jar is not air tight. The jar is then placed in the refrigerator. We typically take the jar out of the refrigerator at around 8:00 PM, and keep the jar in the kitchen. The kefir is filtered at ~ 8:30 AM. During the last 4 months we had travelled a couple of weeks out of our residential town. No problems, keep the grains topped up with milk in the refrigerator till you come back from the travel. One thing I noticed is that the time required for making good kefir is weather dependent. In January, it took a little more time (typically out of the refrigerator at ~ 1:30 PM, peak day temperature in the range of 24C and night temperature of ~ 14C). Thank you Mr. Kefir!

Started as a fun project and got converted as a regular habbit now. Suggestions where we could go wrong: Do not use full fat buffalo milk. It will be very hard to strain as the kefir would be too thick to filter out. Use cow milk preferably, if you don't have the availablity then go for buffalo milk which is not full cream. I used amul milk pasterized 3 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Fabulous product , absolutely delicious as well as beneficial for the gut . The supplier was very helpful in answering all our queries. Highly recommended
The product is pricey. But it delivers. And considering that this is a one time buy, it's worth the cost. The instructions are clear cut. Packaging was also fine. Recommended.

Well no doubt product is excellent... Before buying I was wondering that it might get damag via transportation. But I got surprised when I saw kefir grains were almost quarter teaspoon (small) with one teaspoon of milk. Well I discard all the liquid and strained the grains... Then I put grains into a glass bottle and poured the milk. But in my first attempt I committed a mistake. I put the bottle into my RICE BOX. And after 24 hours when I checked it was over fermented.. It was looking like COTTAGE CHEESE (PANEER) So ASAP I called Mr kefir and told him everything. So he suggested me to keep the bottle in a CLAY POT filled with little water.. I did the same but here is one interesting thing (MAY BE ITS BCZ OF CLIMATE I GUESS) They say it takes atleast 24 hours to get ready kefir curd but in my case its taking only 10 to 12 hours... I am using Buffalo milk of 6 to 8 fat %age. I've checked it almost 5 times by now. Every time when I put it for 24 hours it bcm more sour (which is good) and two times I found it over fermented(which is not good for grains) Regular over fermentation kills live grains.. SO now I make kefir curd twice in a day. First I put it at 8 pm with almost 500ml buffalo milk. Then in morning I strain it at 7am. Then again I make it at 7 am and strain it 8pm. (it totes depends on the temperature of ur city u r living in) Right now here in north India its almost 43° to 45 ° My curd which is almost look like THICK LASSI is doing great... Mr. Kefir is also very nice and helpful person who showed me the right way... M very health conscious guy... May be in the beginning some will think 1200 bucks are tooooo much for only a few grains (which u even can count) but believe me for a lifetime its just nothing (1200 rs) (according to me). Now my grains are healthy and within a month it grows almost two teaspoon. The pic I've shared is almost 15 days old... There are nothing like big or small grains in size only what matters is how healthy grains u have....Its up on you how to treat them..... Well guys I gave 4 star for is it easy to use or not bcz dealing with live kefir grains is very delicate job. Especially if u r a beginner (like me) it requires lots of care... So its not easy to handle it... I know guys u have done ur homework on kefir grains (how healthy they are) so M not gonna lecture on that...

I followed instructions and added milk, after 24 hrs I strained, found butter in strainer(image attached), dropped message and images on whatsapp to understand where are my Kefir grains. this guy highlighted something, I tried to feel the Kefir grains but it was just curd, Since then I am filling a glass bottle with room temperature milk and put strained so called "Kefir grains" and next day strain again, using glass jar, plastic bowl and plastic strainer as given in instructions, doing it from last 20 days but still not seen "kefir grains" like given in image.

Repeating same process from last 20 days but did not see big like Kefir grains like in image 3.

I could also make a delicious Kefir with them. When the grains multiply so much and so easily, I think it is overly priced for no reason. The free strainer was of no use at all since the mesh has a very fine holes, that hardly filters out. Either give a workable strainer or pls do not give at all.

Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 March 2022Verified Purchase Seller really took time to explain the process, step by step. The grains are really good quality. If you have never tasted Kefir before you will feel odd as it is little sour, but once you get used to it then it tastes awesome. I just add my protein powder and make lassi out of it. Within 3 weeks my grains grew to a large quantity, just to confirm I contacted the seller and he was kind enough to identify if the grains have indeed grown. I have so much grains now that I can easily create 3 different batches of Kefir (Not that I need it). I have now saved the extra grains in milk and stored it in my refrigerator. I suggest everyone to just follow the instructions provided by the seller. Use full fat (whole) milk. Don't use the long shelf life milk that comes in tetra pack. I am from Karnataka so we get awesome Nandini milk, I use the full fat milk (Orange Packet). If you want a good quality Kefir grains this is the best in the market. Initial package comes with Kefir Grain and a plastic strainer. Bhanu Prakash 5.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant Grains. Helpful Seller. Must Buy.

It is quite easy making Kefir, simply at room temperature. However, timing has to be maintained as it gets sours if you keep for more than 8 hours which is now used to it to strain the kefir at the onset of time. But the grain size is too little which needs to be taken care. Hope the size will increase as the grains are used continuously with the expectation that new layers of bacteria will add to increase in size.

When I opened the box was impressed by looking at perfect fit of box and strain accompanied by thoughtful packaging to protect Grains. Grains were sealed in a nice small bottle and again packed in a protective zip lock bag. Initially I used buffalo milk which is high in fat content. It gave good thick amount of curd in small time. But looking at the increasing difficulty to separate grains from curd with each batch switched to full fat cow milk and got extremely satisfying result. See the pic :-) Of course, the seller is as helpful as described in all reviews and was in contact daily till the grains attained a visible shape and size. These grains are doubled in size in these days proving its strength and superior quality when delivered. Loved the flavor of buttermilk drink and taste of curd for eating with parathas. Would recommended it to all the fitness concious shoppers out there!

Kefir has replaced my daily glass of buttermilk - once you get the hang of it (and Mr Kefir is quite prompt in answering all the queries and concerns one may have), it’s so very easy to make it at home … Thank you, Mr Kefir!
These kefir grains are good as they grow fast and kefir quality is good. Seller was very responsive whenever I tried to reach him over whatsapp and call.
I am using kefir grains for the last one month and my experience for it is awesome . The grains are of the best quality and the prepared mixture is so smooth and tasty . I am lactose intolerant guy and it is still suiting me so i am really satisfied with the grains . And i want to also mention the dealer who is too friendly and helped me in every step of it . All the queries regarding grains or preparation techniques is thorouhly described to me . So the contact support i got is phenomenal . Big thumps up . Surely give it a try

I followed instructions and added milk, after 24 hrs I strained, found butter in strainer(image attached), dropped message and images on whatsapp to understand where are my Kefir grains. this guy highlighted something, I tried to feel the Kefir grains but it was just curd, Since then I am filling a glass bottle with room temperature milk and put strained so called "Kefir grains" and next day strain again, using glass jar, plastic bowl and plastic strainer as given in instructions, doing it from last 20 days but still not seen "kefir grains" like given in image.

Repeating same process from last 20 days but did not see big like Kefir grains like in image 3. It taste very good like curd you get in small villages, there people don't buy curd from market but use last day curd again next day. 4. its definitely over prices since big kefir grains were not there. not happy with kefir grains i received, but taste was good Read more One person found this helpful Top critical reviewCritical reviews› AnuAks3.0 out of 5 starsCould have been less priced with better filterReviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 May 2023Grains were well packed and reached within a day.

The price is exorbitant and almost the same what I paid in the US but no other viable option. For this price I would have appreciated a quick delivery so that the grains do not die. I am not sure how many strains have survived the 5 day delivery stress in this very hot climate. Also the grains size is the smallest possible almost like curd. I hope they grow but that would take extremely long time I suppose. My biggest worry is the number of strains of bacteria and yeast that would survive the delivery stress. Some varieties of bacteria and yeast grows quicker than the rest, so if they die in transit then kefir is not much more than powdered kefir starter or curd. Highly dissatisfied.

Extremely helpful ensures you get more than a bang for your buck. Prior to this I was buying kefir buttermilk locally at roughly 450 rs a bottle. That was convenient, though expensive and I did not have control over the taste of the curd. Now, it requires more effort, almost like a drill but the returns... Thanks to Mr. kefir's guidance my grains have grown almost 5 fold in a month. I have had to feed it every day, but I can make it sour, creamy, curdy anyway I feel like having it!! It's more than paisa vasool!!

Mr.kefir grains are in great quality when i got delivered.After i recievedit,i ask about the making process,the seller explained so cleary about the method and its easy to make kefir on daily basis. its nutritional and health benefits are so great for the body.Try it, if u want to make kefirs!!
I have been using this Grain for three months. When i have got initially itself it have worked for me well. This Grain are very live and fresh and Iam happy with what i have got.
The greains were healthy. The customer support is very helpful in terms of growing the grains and making the kefir properly.
If u want quality kefir grains and quality customer service....this is the right place ..dnt think further just buy it...the product is good and the seller is too good ...he personally explains u everything ...it's worth every penny trust me...I've seen massive change in my health .....my leaky gut syndrome is better than ever ...my gut is happy let me tell you that
Kefir grain are good in condition and growing well in size.
I am used to making kefir and used to do it in the US. The price is exorbitant and almost the same what I paid in the US but no other viable option. For this price I would have appreciated a quick delivery so that the grains do not die. I am not sure how many strains have survived the 5 day delivery stress in this very hot climate. Also the grains size is the smallest possible almost like curd. I hope they grow but that would take extremely long time I suppose. My biggest worry is the number of strains of bacteria and yeast that would survive the delivery stress. Some varieties of bacteria and yeast grows quicker than the rest, so if they die in transit then kefir is not much more than powdered kefir starter or curd. Highly dissatisfied.
I was looking for kefir grains to buy online. I doubted whether we can get good quality kefir grains in India. Mr. kefir was excellent. Drinking kefir milk has helped me with my gastric problem. They provide little amount of grains for starter.It’s now about one and half month buying and the grains have multiplied. See the pic. I would surely recommend buying the grains from Mr. kefir, if looking for one in India. Buy it once and it lasts a lifetime. 👍🏽

It's a month since I took delivery. In the one month, I have reached out to Mr. Kefir five times and he has responded seven times!! Extremely helpful ensures you get more than a bang for your buck. Prior to this I was buying kefir buttermilk locally at roughly 450 rs a bottle. That was convenient, though expensive and I did not have control over the taste of the curd. Now, it requires more effort, almost like a drill but the returns... Thanks to Mr. kefir's guidance my grains have grown almost 5 fold in a month. I have had to feed it every day, but I can make it sour, creamy, curdy anyway I feel like having it!! It's more than paisa vasool!! Thanks Mr. Kefir, your service orientation has been overwhelming!
Love the texture and nature of grains . I am making 700-800 gm of thick kefir regularly, much better thickness than just regular yogurt with more healthy gut bacteria. Even customer care support is good .

Top positive reviewPositive reviews› Ajay Hada4.0 out of 5 starsReceived very small kefir grains in a small bottle but they were not like shown in imageReviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 23 June 2023I paid 899 and ordered the kefir grains, received a small 30ml bottle filled with curd(not like image). I followed instructions and added milk, after 24 hrs I strained, found butter in strainer(image attached), dropped message and images on whatsapp to understand where are my Kefir grains. this guy highlighted something, I tried to feel the Kefir grains but it was just curd, Since then I am filling a glass bottle with room temperature milk and put strained so called "Kefir grains" and next day strain again, using glass jar, plastic bowl and plastic strainer as given in instructions, doing it from last 20 days but still not seen "kefir grains" like given in image. What i am feeling after 20 days. 1. Taste of this curd is far better then the packed curd available in market. 2. Repeating same process from last 20 days but did not see big like Kefir grains like in image 3. It taste very good like curd you get in small villages, there people don't buy curd from market but use last day curd again next day. 4. its definitely over prices since big kefir grains were not there. not happy with kefir grains i received, but taste was good Read more One person found this helpful Top critical reviewCritical reviews› AnuAks3.0 out of 5 starsCould have been less priced with better filterReviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 May 2023Grains were well packed and reached within a day.

Do not buy Kefir spores from this seller as it contains white coloured leeches in it which are really difficult to see as they are exactly the same colour as Kefir. This is highly dangerous and would surely make you sick. Besides, the seller is highly uncooperative and refuses to do anything about it when informed. There are plenty of other sources on Amazon or elsewhere to buy this and at much cheaper rates. This seller in anycase is charging highly unreasonable price.

This is the first time I purchased kefir grains and I had no trouble making kefir. The seller is available on call/text and will guide you through the milk fermentation process and answer any queries you may have. I highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking to try it out.
Low the temperature.. grains grow faster... Also suggestions from seller are very helpful
These milk kefir grains are of very good quality. Kefir made with these grains has improved our gut health a lot. Quantity of the grains has become double in 20 days. Very happy with the purchase and will recommend these grains.
Works as expected. Simple process. Supplier is very supportive and receptive. It will be good to have the product certified from an independent on whether it has all types of live bacteria as expected.
This is the first time we have ever used kefir grains to make curd. We bought it beacuse it is healthy. Initially we did not know how to use the grains to make healthy kefir curd. But once we got hang of the process, we are making kefir curd every day. The curd is tasty. Our kids also enjoy the taste of the curd. We are enjoying the tatse as well as the health benifits of the kefir curd.
Great quality and quantity of grains. Have been making kefir for a while but wasn’t happy with the grains I found before. These grains are the best I’ve used and great customer support too.
I like everything about the product , only positive remarks.
Kefir grains are small , so u need to use the double mesh strainer they provide along with kefir

I am getting the health benefits from consuming kefir on a daily basis. It’s been almost 5 months since I bought the grains and have managed to keep them alive and thriving. Follow the instructions given by Mr. Kefir and remember that being a helpful person he is always there to clear your doubts in case you may have any! Kefir is a hidden gem that most people have not discovered and it is the best way to consume probiotics in their natural form.

In some ways, I would have liked to give 5 stars; however, there are a few cons with the purchase. Overall, I would recommend going with this seller for kefir grains. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: —There is EXCELLENT customer service provided from the seller. Mr. Kefir is respectful and caring and truly wants to help make the process go smoothly for his customers. — The grains are covered by a one time 6 months no-questions-asked warranty —The grains are shipped in nice packaging with a spoon, strainer, personal note from the seller, and an instruction manual with contact information. —The grains produce kefir well, which is what the goal is, right!? Cons: — The price is very high for the size and amount of grains you get. —The tiny size of the grains makes straining/finding your grains a little challenging. —The strainer given is not good for straining kefir. It was very challenging to strain my kefir with the double mesh strainer, especially when the temperature was hot, producing very thick kefir so quickly. To solve this problem, I cut out one of the strainer layers with scissors, and the process became a thousand times easier! TAKE NOTE: Sometimes when people think their grains have multiplied/gotten bigger, it may just be kefir curds which have not yet gone through the strainer. This is especially true when using the double mesh strainer. Just because you have big lumps, does not mean you have bigger kefir grains. For those of you who may have a sourdough starter, kefir is similar (definitely not the same, but similar) in how it works with temperature. However, know that kefir grains are more sensitive to temperature changes, so they are not as forgiving as a sourdough starter when you forget to feed them or put them in the fridge. When the kefir grains grow larger, they can stand a little more change, but these baby grains have to be babied. 30 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Mr. Kefir also gives you all the hand holding you may need to learn the process of setting your kefir curd. It's worth the money spent. And best of all I think it has already improved my digestion a good deal after consuming it daily for the last 15 days or so. So I would say, just go for it. Thanks.

I used it at first with whole cow's milk supplied by my neighbourhood dairy, and ran into a few issues because the fat was not evenly distributed in the milk. I sought support from Mr Kefir over the phone and on WhatsApp to overcome these teething problems. His response was simply superb, and he handheld me over the succeeding days to get properly set kefir. After this experience, I can say that the novice should start with pasteurized, homogenized milk. I have shown the packets of two brands that have worked well for me. The kefir is ready once the contents do not move when fermentation bottle is tilted. After straining, the kefir grains may be re-used to make another batch. The resulting kefir is tangy and tart and feels very good to eat. Highly recommended. Enjoy!
